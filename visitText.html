                <p>
                    For the <a href="Tourism.html">Tourism</a> website that I and my group made, we were each tasked with choosing a country to base our work around. The country that I picked for this project was Italy. One of the many things that we were tasked with doing for this project was writing text for our users. <br><br>  Part of the text we were required to write was centered around places that our users could potentially stay in the country(i.e lodges, apartments, etc.), and ways in which they can get to the country. For the locations, something we had to consider was where these locations were, their significance, and how staying there would make the experience of people staying there even better. As for the ways to get to the country, something considered was the experience offered by the trip - the scenery especially. <br><br> However, as one could imagine, I did not pull this information out of thin air. There was a fair bit of research involved. Something we had to incorporate within the research was to make sure that our picked locations properly show cultural traditions of the country, to reflect the way in which those people might live their lives. <br><br> Researching these locations and their relevancies taught me a lot about conducting research, and learning how to optimize the process - refine what you're searching, pay close attention to what's being said and what it means. Additionally, when researching something I found myself doing was investigating one of the CART habits of mind. Without investigating information, research is impossible.
