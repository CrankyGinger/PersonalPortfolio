            The second website I ever had the chance to make was a tourism website designed for young adults looking to explore the world. This was also the first site of mine in which I would work with other people to make it, from start to end we worked as a team. The site was centered around grabbing the attention of younger people to hopefully make them want to travel to different countries all over the world. <br><br> Each member of the team had their own country that they selected in the initial wireframing phase, and then centered all their work around it. I worked on Italy, and all the respective pages that came with it. Something that I wanted in my pages was for them to feel like a travel site, but also feel Italian - something that helped me greatly get this done was the use of images. When designing web pages, something I've learned is that pictures on a page can completely change the feel of a site. <br><br> One of the hardest things about the site was making sure that all the pages feel consistent, so that the website feels like one site, and not different pages connected to each other. One of the constants in developing this site would be talking to my group members about our respective pages, see the similarities and differences between them, and then think of a way to streamline our page content. <br><br> Being our second website, we still faced challenges with arranging content, especially relative to each other. I remember there being times where I would try to position one element on a page, but in doing so another element on the page would be moved somewhere else. But, I kept on persevering through the challenge of making CSS work. Something I've learned from the process of making web pages is that CSS is extremely unlikely to work properly on the first attempt.
